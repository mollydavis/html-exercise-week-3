        <p>
            <b>Venus (/ˈviːnəs/)</b>[a] is a Roman goddess, whose functions encompassed love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. 
            In Roman mythology, she was the ancestor of the Roman people through her son, 
            Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy and fled to Italy. Julius Caesar claimed her as his ancestor. Venus was central to many religious festivals, 
            and was revered in Roman religion under numerous cult titles.

            The Romans adapted the myths and iconography of her Greek counterpart <b>Aphrodite</b> for Roman art and Latin literature. In the later classical 
            tradition of the West, Venus became one of the most widely referenced deities of Greco-Roman mythology as the embodiment of love and sexuality. 
            She is usually depicted nude in paintings.

        Venus has been described as perhaps<b> "the most original creation of the Roman pantheon",[5]: 146  and "an ill-defined and assimilative" native goddess, 
        combined "with a strange and exotic Aphrodite".</b>[b] Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, 
        in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of
         divine forces through magic.[5]: 13–64 [7] The ambivalence of her persuasive functions has been perceived in the relationship of the root *wenos- with its 
         Latin derivative venenum ('poison'; from *wenes-no 'love drink' or 'addicting'),[8] in the sense of "a charm, magic philtre".[9]

        <p>In myth, Venus-Aphrodite was born, already in adult form, from the sea foam (Greek αφρός, aphros) produced by the severed genitals of Caelus-Uranus.[10] 
            Roman theology presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life. Her male counterparts in the Roman 
            pantheon, Vulcan and Mars, are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. 
            She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good 
            fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue. Varro's 
            theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle. To generate life, the watery matrix of the womb requires the virile warmth of fire. 
            To sustain life, water and fire must be balanced; excess of either one, or their mutual antagonism, are unproductive or destructive.
